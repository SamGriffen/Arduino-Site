	<p>Did you know that you can actually use everybody&apos;s favourite rotating cat with Arduino? I won't teach you how. That is for another day. But in place of it, please enjoy this lesson on the Scratch cat. The Scratch cat has been a well known, friendly character for generations. There are many different forms of the scratch cat. These include the Neigh Pony, which can be found <a href="https://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/w/images/Neigh_pony.png" target="_blank">here</a>. There is a grey 404 error scratch cat, found <a href="https://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/w/images/404_Image.png" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
	<p>Of course, the most common iteration of the scratch cat is the inevitable spinning Scratch Cat. Commonly known for it&apos;s implementation in by previous year 12 students. This is depicted below as the SVG file for the scratch cat is licenced under a CC-BY-SA licence. Which means that if I tell you that the creator is Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab, and the original uploader was Andresmh at English Wikipedia. Then I link you to <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Scratchcat.svg">where you can find it</a>, I am allowed to use it! So behold below, the Scratch cat in all it&apos;s glory.</p>

	<p>Finally, there is an important Scratch cat appearance in the computer science labs of Dr Leslie. Dr Leslie makes great use of the Scratch cat, as has imparted his artistic impression of the cat upon us:</p>
