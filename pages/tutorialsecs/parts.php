			<h1>What will you Need?</h1>
		</header>
		<p>Obviously, you will need some parts to build the things in this tutorial. All of these parts are available <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/product/GKX00007" target="_blank">here at the Arduino store</a>. But some of us donâ€™t have that kind of money, so the solution for the rest of us, is eBay or Aliexpress. It doesn't matter how you get the parts, just get them.<p>

			<li>
				<div class="part-image">
					<img src="img/tutorial-images/parts/arduino.png" alt="Image of an Arduino. An important component when working with Arduino.">
				</div>
				<p>An Arduino UNO! You should have a USB cable to connect it to your computer, this would have come with the board.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="part-image">
					<img src="img/tutorial-images/parts/leds.png" alt="Image of some LEDs. An important component when working with Arduino.">
				</div>
				<p>A pile of LEDs! Maybe different colours, maybe not. Get creative!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="part-image">
					<img src="img/tutorial-images/parts/resistors.png" alt="Image of a few resistors. Important components when working with Arduino.">
				</div>
				<p>A collection of 470 &Omega; resistors. Vital for any LED projects. You could substitute these with 220 &Omega; resistors, or any other value (Just don't go too low or your LED might go poof!)</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="part-image">
					<img src="img/tutorial-images/parts/breadboard.png" alt="Image of a breadboard. Important components when working with Arduino.">
				</div>
				<p>A breadboard. These are how we connect different components together when working on a project. They are very important, as otherwise we need to get out the soldering iron.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="part-image">
					<img src="img/tutorial-images/parts/buttons.png" alt="Image of some buttons. Important components when working with Arduino.">
				</div>
				<p>A few tactile switches (Little buttons). They come in all shapes and sizes, all you need are some push buttons. The ones in the image are based on what they look like onboard an Arduino.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="part-image">
					<img src="img/tutorial-images/parts/jumpers.png" alt="Image of breadboard jumper wires. Important components when working with Arduino.">
				</div>
				<p>Breadboard Jumper wires. These are how we connect all the components together during a project.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>After collecting all the components, you are ready to move on!</p>
