		<p>So, you&apos;re wondering what an Arduino is? Maybe you have one, and you are wondering at this little blue board in front of you, &quot;What do I do with it?&quot; you may be thinking. Maybe you know a little bit about it, and you&apos;ve heard about this language called C++, and wonder what it is, and what it has to do with anything? With all these questions on your mind, you decide you want to learn about this awesome tool, that can be used for anything from building robots, to monitoring the weather.</p>

		<p>If you can relate to a large proportion of the above, then this tutorial is probably for you. Arduino is an &quot;open-source prototyping platform&quot;. In very basic terms, an Arduino board will read inputs, process them, and use them to control outputs. Inputs can be pretty much anything. From something as simple as a switch, or something more awesome like a laser. Outputs could be simple things such as LEDs and buzzers, to things such as motors, to weirder things like tongue displays (No, seriously. I&apos;m not joking. This is pretty weird: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUyoVHjXF3A" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/zUyoVHjXF3A</a>). With a combination of these inputs and outputs, and a little bit of electrical knowledge (Don&apos;t worry, it is surprisingly easy) you can build and program complex systems that can accomplish wonderful things.</p>

		<p>This tutorial aims to teach you what you need to know to get off the ground with Arduino. First you&apos;ll learn how to set up your environment, I will go over some very basic circuit concepts, and then we will jump into doing some programming. It is suggested that you have some background in using something like Python, or JavaScript. Or some other language that has given you knowledge of variables and maybe even functions. I will try to explain every part of the code, however in places explaining everything could take too long, so I strongly recommend that you have some experience in these things first.</p>

		<p>Over this tutorial you will work on a few different projects. These will be things such as animating a row of lights, creating a rainbow light, and physically manipulating the world around you. I know that this block of text is scary, trust me, the rest is more interesting</p>

		<p>Now, shall we begin?</p>
